# 📖 Lifebook

> A private digital archive for families to preserve and relive life’s most meaningful moments.

Built with ❤️ by **Alynx Technologies**

## 🌿 Overview

Lifebook is a private, role-based web application that allows families to store, organize, and relive memories through photos, videos, and comments.

It is designed to feel warm, intimate, and emotionally resonant — not like a social media feed, but like a living digital photobook.

This repository contains the MVP version scheduled for release within 1 week.

## 🔐 Authentication

All routes under `/home` are protected.

Unauthenticated users are redirected to:

```
/auth
```

Account creation requires an invite token generated by an admin.

---

## 🖼 Memory Model (MVP Conceptual)

Each memory section contains:

- Title
- Ordered list of media
- Media type (image/video)
- Optional caption
- Associated comments

Each comment contains:

- User reference
- Text content
- Timestamp

---

## 💬 Notifications (MVP)

Users are notified when:
- A new comment is added to a memory.

Clicking a notification:
